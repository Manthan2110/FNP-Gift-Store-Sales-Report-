🎁 FNP Gift Store Sales Report (Microsoft Excel) 📊

Because Nothing Says "Data Love" Like a Well-Organized Sales Report!

Welcome to the Ferns N Petals (FNP) Gift Store Sales Report, where Excel magic meets the world of flowers, cakes, and adorable gift hampers. This project is all about transforming raw sales data into actionable insights—because what’s the point of selling thousands of roses if you don’t know which city loves them the most?

🌟 What This Project Does (Besides Making Excel Look Cool)

This yearly sales report isn't just a bunch of numbers on a spreadsheet; it’s a full-fledged analytics dashboard designed to help FNP make better business decisions (and maybe sell even more last-minute Valentine’s gifts). Here’s what it offers:

✔ Automated data cleaning using Power Query, because no one enjoys manually fixing messy data.

✔ DAX measures for advanced calculations, making sure the numbers actually make sense (because math is hard).

✔ Interactive Pivot Tables to slice and dice revenue, total orders, and other key metrics like a pro.

✔ Top 5 cities analysis—because not all cities love flowers equally (sorry, some of you are just less romantic).

✔ Best-selling products report, identifying the ultimate crowd favorites (spoiler alert: cakes and roses are probably winning).

Microsoft Excel – The OG of data analysis.

Power Query – To clean data faster than you can say "Ctrl+Z."
